# Interactive-and-Dynamic-Excel-Dashboard

Created interactive and dynamic dashboard created in MS Excel to display business KPIs.

***What I learned:***
- Calculated KPIs - Total Sales, Total boxes sold, Profit Margin.
- created KPI cards for Total Sales, Profit Margin (Profit %), Total Boxes.
- created bar chart to display Top 5 Products in each category, and trend charts for sales, boxes and profit.
- created Matrix to display Sales Person performance based on Product and/or Category selection.
Conditional formatting on Sales and Profit % columns. Implemented dynamic table title based on selection of slicer.
